YOUR REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THIS SITE, OR ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, CONTENT, OR OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THIS SITE, IS TO STOP USING THE SITE AND/OR THOSE PARTICULAR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. YOUR AGREEMENT WITH US REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE BECOMES EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON COMMENCEMENT OF YOUR USE OF THIS SITE.

You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this site and these Terms of Service periodically and to be aware of any modifications.

<h2>2.	Description of Services</h2>

<p>We make various services available on this site including, but not limited to, a Web-based application for online text file editing.

With Text Editor you can open a text file of your choice, and then edit and save it. There are currently no fees associated with using the app provided through this site, as the company is paid through advertising. You are solely responsible for providing, at your own expense, all equipment necessary to use the services, including a computer and your own Internet access (including payment of service fees associated with such access).  Visware LLC neither receives, processes, or claims ownership of any user data uploaded to the site, as all file processing is done on the user's computer or device, in the browser, without server-side processing.
